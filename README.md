## About

My family is extended across the globe. A major inspiration for Foreign Ipsum is my friends and family all over the world. I wanted to make a plugin which incorporated the languages they spoke so I sent them messages asking for random texts in the languages they knew. With their replies, Foreign Ipsum's content is what they came back with.
